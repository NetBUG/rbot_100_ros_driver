# rbot_100_ros_driver
R.Bot 100 driver for ROS

# Python demo
`pydemo` folder contains a sample application written in Python to demonstrate the ability to control the robot manually with the keyboard.
However, the actual code is different and is written in C++.

# Requirements
The script works with Python 2. It's technically compatible with Python 3, but handling bytewise operations is more complicated with built-in encoding conversions.
